## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Callista!

I graduated from my **B.Sc. Computer Science** at McGill University and I am currently pursuing a **M.Sc. in Human Computer Interaction and Design** with EIT Digital where I get the opportunity to obtain a double degree, with my first year being at  Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid in Spain and my second being at Aalto University in Finland. 

I am interested in **Fullstack Web Development** with experience in designing and implementing web apps from beginning to end. I am also currently in the process of learning iOS developement. However, having taken a variety of classes in ML, Data Science, and more, I am always open to learning new things! 

My previous positions include being a software developer intern at LiveGuard, a Monteal-based startup, a technical sales intern at IBM Canada, and a teaching assistant at McGill University.
