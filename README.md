## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Callista!

I recently graduated from my **BSc Computer Science** at McGill University. I am interested in **Fullstack Web Development** with experience in designing and implementing web apps from beginning to end. I am also currently in the process of learning iOS developement. However, having taken a variety of classes in ML, Data Science, and more, I am always open to learning new things! 

I am currently working as a software developer intern at LiveGuard, a Monteal-based startup. Following my internship, I look forward to starting my Master's with EIT Digital in Human Computer Interaction and Design where I will spend the first year of my program studying at Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid in Spain and my second year at Aalto University in Finland.
